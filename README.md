#  SDG 3 ‚Äî Disease Outbreak Prediction using Machine Learning

This project supports **Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health & Well-being)** by predicting potential disease outbreaks using open-source health and environmental data.

##  Overview

Early detection of outbreaks enables faster government and NGO responses, better allocation of medical resources, and timely awareness campaigns.

Using **supervised learning (Random Forest classifier)**, the model predicts whether a region is likely to experience an outbreak in the next period based on:
- Historical case counts
- Weather conditions (temperature, rainfall)
- Mobility indices
- Healthcare expenditure data

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **TensorFlow (optional)**

---

##  Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalizing, feature engineering (lag features, per capita cases)
2. **Model Training:** Random Forest classifier to predict next-period outbreak
3. **Evaluation:** Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC
4. **Visualization:** Feature importance & ROC curve
5. **Deployment (Demo):** Simple notebook predictions + Streamlit dashboard plan

---

## Results (Demo Dataset)
| Metric | Score |
|:--|:--|
| Accuracy | 0.88 |
| F1-score | 0.81 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.86 |

Top predictors:  
- Previous case counts  
- Precipitation (rainfall)  
- Mobility trends  

---

##  Ethical Considerations
- Use only aggregated, anonymized health data  
- Ensure fairness: models must adapt to underreported regions  
- Predictions must inform, not automate, public-health responses

##  How This Supports SDG 3
This project addresses **Target 3.D**: *‚ÄúStrengthen the capacity for early warning, risk reduction, and management of national and global health risks.‚Äù*

By predicting potential outbreaks early, governments and health organizations can:
- Deploy medical staff proactively
- Stock essential medicines in advance
- Prevent large-scale epidemics through early intervention
